# Flow of the process

Basically in this website you can search for a person based on his/her email.

You click on the "GO!" button, here we could get 3 different results:
    
    1. If you type a valid email you'll get the information of the person.
    2. If you type a invalid email you will get this message "The email you've searched for is not in our system!"
    3. If you don't type an email you'll get this message "Please type an email in the field bellow!"

# Files of the project

I tried to create some sections dynamically so, you will find a file for each section, e.g. for the header we have a header.js which contains all the logic of this section, a header.css which contains all the style attributes of this section.

If we need to add this section in any page we just need to:
1. Import the file on the html
2. Add a container with this id "header"

Same for "footer" and "result".
